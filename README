Readme
======

This is the readme for the Annie project.

= Description

The Annie project has the aim of building a hobby operating system, based on
the X86 platform (initially) and written in D and also assembler.

= Requirements

To build this software you need (or will need when there are sources in this):

* gnu gdc (aka gnu d compiler from https://bitbucket.org/goshawk/gdc/wiki/Home)
* nasm (from http://www.nasm.us/)
* asciidoc (but only if you intent to rebuild the documentation from they sources)
* docbook (but only if you need to create pdf's or something from the documentation generated by asciidoc)
* git (if you intent to track the source, but if you're reading this you probably already have it)
* An extra dose of patient.

= Objectives

* To build a D based operating system, capable of booting in any multiboot compliant bootloader;
* Support elf format;
* Be able to load modules from both User space (like a microkernel) and Kernel space (like a monolithic kernel);
* Be able to support the running of multiple OS's though a builtin virtual machine mechanism;
* Support the scheduling of virtual machine tasks just like a regular task;
* Have builtin support for printers, scanners and other media devices;
* Have builtin support for video devices, including 3D support, instead of the old line based management of Unix;
* Support the usage of a message based api for networking, so that writing for a network system is similar to write a kernel module;
* Support a object oriented API, based on interfaces that are easy to implement;
